# Common Issues

Solutions to the most frequently encountered problems with SF Data Export Automation.

## :material-shield-alert: Authentication Issues

### SFDX Auth URL Problems

!!! failure "‚ùå No SFDX_AUTH_URL found in secrets"
    
    **Cause:** The automation can't find your authentication credentials.
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check secret name** - must be exactly `SFDX_AUTH_URL`
    2. **Verify notebook access** - toggle must be ON (‚úÖ)
    3. **Add the secret** if missing:
        - Click üîë key icon in Colab sidebar
        - Add new secret with name `SFDX_AUTH_URL`
        - Paste your complete Auth URL
        - Enable notebook access
    
    **Test:** Re-run the authentication cell

!!! failure "‚ùå Authentication failed: Invalid grant"
    
    **Cause:** Your SFDX Auth URL has expired or is invalid.
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Generate new Auth URL:**
        ```bash
        sf org login web --target-org your-org
        sf org display --verbose --target-org your-org
        ```
    2. **Update Colab secret** with new Auth URL
    3. **Check for typos** in the Auth URL
    4. **Verify org access** - try logging into Salesforce manually
    
    **Prevention:** Refresh Auth URLs every 30-90 days

!!! failure "‚ùå This org appears to have a problem"
    
    **Cause:** Salesforce org is inaccessible or has restrictions.
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Test org access** - log into Salesforce web interface
    2. **Check org status** - verify not in maintenance mode
    3. **Verify user permissions** - ensure API and Data Export access
    4. **Try different user** - test with admin account
    5. **Check IP restrictions** - may need to whitelist Colab IPs
    
    **Note:** Some orgs have API access restrictions

### Permission Problems

!!! failure "‚ùå Insufficient privileges"
    
    **Cause:** Your Salesforce user lacks required permissions.
    
    **Required Permissions:**
    - API Enabled
    - Data Export
    - View Setup and Configuration
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Contact Salesforce admin** to grant permissions
